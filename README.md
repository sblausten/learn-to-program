# Exercises from Chris Pine's Ruby based ['Learn to Program']( https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/) book

I didn't paste in the instruction text at the top for some of the exercises unfortunately. 

If you're interested, please refer to the relevant exercise number in the online book when this is the case. 
Otherwsie it should be fairly self evident what they are doing as the ruby is super simple!
Sorry :)
