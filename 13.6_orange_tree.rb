=begin Orange tree. Make an OrangeTree class that has a height method that
returns its height and a one_year_passes method that, when called, ages the
tree one year.

Each year the tree grows taller (however much you think an orange tree should
grow in a year), and after some number of years (again, your call) the tree
should die.

For the first few years, it should not produce fruit, but after a while it
should, and I guess that older trees produce more each year than younger
treesâ€¦whatever you think makes the most sense.

And, of course, you should be able to count_the_oranges (which returns the
number of oranges on the tree) and pick_an_orange (which reduces the
@orange_count by 1 and returns a string telling you how delicious the orange
was, or else it just tells you that there are no more oranges to pick this
year).

Make sure any oranges you donâ€™t pick one year fall off before the next year.
